## :bulb: About me:

I have a degree in veterinary medicine and, a few years ago, I embraced the challenge of transitioning into the technology field. I am a curious person who loves technology, and I am always seeking professional growth, which were the main reasons behind my decision.

In 2021, I began my degree in Analysis and Systems Development at Anhembi Morumbi University, graduating in 2023.

During this time, I worked as an intern at IBM through the Associates program, where I collaborated with the Software Quality Assurance team. My main responsibilities included conducting functional and non functional tests, preparing acceptance tests for user validation, identifying bugs and discrepancies with documentation, and finally documenting the tests performed.

In addition to my academic knowledge, I'm always studing and leaning new features. I have some certifications:  **[Accredited Software Testing Fundamentals Certification (AICSÂ® ASTFC)](https://badgr.com/public/assertions/16xXm4hDQ8uZpNO2_-cYpA?), [Databricks Fundamentals](https://credentials.databricks.com/0b5adace-085c-4e17-b46f-73a47174fff8), [AZ-900](https://www.credly.com/badges/7bcd5455-112b-49c6-ab67-8a07081e7008), [DP-900](https://www.credly.com/badges/2ac5231f-0173-4ac6-997a-f94d0224c8aa), [Scrum Foundation Professional Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/cdd0128a-662a-46d4-8e0f-d1ef85d968c9)**  and I am currently seeking new certifications. I have a good knowledge of Python, SQL, HTML, Bash scripting and Power BI. I am familiar with Azure Plataform (ADF, Azure Databricks, Azure Test Plans), AWS platforms (S3, EC2, RedShift, Kinesis)  and Linux operating systems. I also work with tools such as Selenium, SoapUi, and Postman. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in tools like Docker, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, etc.

I'm a **native Portugueses speaker** and I have proficiency in **English (C1)** and intermediate level in **Spanish (B2)**.
